        <h3> <a name="how"> </a> How long does it take to learn english </h3>
        <p class="bigger">A beginner can learn English in a year. That’s pretty fast, although not as fast as some of the crazy 15-day promises you see online. Specifically, a year is the average amount of time it will take an adult to become fluent enough to work in English if he starts out as a beginner and studies at least 5 hours a day. But everyone is different.</p>
<p class="red"> <strong>How long it will take you to learn English depends on many things:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your current level of English;</li>
<li>The level of English you need (Hint: for most people, upper intermediate is enough);</li>
<li>Which languages you already speak;</li>
<li>If you’re living in an English-speaking country;</li>
<li>How hard you study;</li>
<li>How much you practice;</li>
<li>How good you are at learning languages.</li>
</ul>
            
      </p>

      </p>
        
      <p class="bigger">There are three main verb tenses in English: present, past and future. The present, past and future tenses are divided into four aspects: the simple, progressive, perfect and perfect progressive. There are 12 major verb tenses that English learners should know.</p>
        
      <p class="big"><strong>Simple Tenses:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Simple present: <em>I drive home every day</em>;</li>
<li>Simple past: <em>I drove home yesterday</em>;</li>  
<li>Simple future: <em>I will drive home later;</em></li>  
</ul> </p>

    <p class="big"><strong>Progressive (Continuous) Tenses:</strong>
<ul>
<li> Past progressive: <em> I was driving when you called</em>;</li>
<li>Present progressive: <em>I am driving now</em>;</li>  
<li>Future progressive: <em>I will be driving when you call;</em></li>  
</ul> </p>

 <p class="big"><strong>Perfect Progressive Tenses:</strong>
<ul>
<li> Present perfect progressive: <em>I have been driving since this morning</em>;</li>
<li>Past perfect progressive: <em>I had been driving for three hours before I stopped to get gas</em>;</li>  
<li>Future perfect progressive: <em> I will have been driving for five hours by the time I arrive;</em></li>  
</ul> </p>
